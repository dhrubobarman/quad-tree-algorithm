# Quad Tree Algorithm
This project is about implementing and visualizing a quad tree data structure. A quad tree is a tree that divides a two-dimensional space into four quadrants recursively. It can be used for various applications such as image compression, spatial indexing, collision detection, and more.


<h2>Features</h2>
<img src='https://github.com/dhrubobarman/quad-tree-algorithm/blob/main/public/preview2.png?raw=true' alt='preview2' />
<ul>
<li>Create and manipulate quad trees from points</li>
<li>Visualize quad trees with different levels of detail</li>
<li>Search for nodes or nearest neighbors in a quad tree</li>
<!-- <li>Perform operations such as intersection, union, or difference on quad trees</li> -->
</ul>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>To install this project, you need to have Node.js version 14.18+ or 16+ installed on your machine. You also need to install the dependencies by running:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">yarn install
</code></pre>
<h2>Usage</h2>
This is a project that uses <a href="https://vitejs.dev/" target='_blank'>vite</a> as a build tool for modern web development.
For more information, please visit <a href="https://vitejs.dev/" target='_blank'>vitejs.dev</a>.
<p>To run this project, you can use the following npm scripts:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>yarn dev</code>: Starts a dev server that provides rich feature enhancements over native ES modules, such as extremely fast hot module replacement (HMR).</li>
<li><code>yarn build</code>: Bundles your code with Rollup, pre-configured to output highly optimized static assets for production.</li>
<li><code>yarn preview</code>: Serves the built app for preview. Note that this is only for previewing the build locally and not meant as a production server.</li>
</ul>
